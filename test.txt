At dawn, Ra was seen as a newborn child, issuing from the sky or a heavenly cow. By midday, Ra was thought of as a flying bird or sailing boat. At sunset, Ra was seen as an old man descending into the land of the dead. Overnight, Ra sailed on a boat eastward through the Underworld in preparation for the next day's ascent. Along the way he had to battle or evade Apep, the great serpent of the Underworld, who sought to devour him. Part of the worship of Ra involved creating magic to aid or protect Ra in his nightly struggle with Apep, thus assuring the return of the sun. \n\nLater in the ancient Egyptian period, Ra was diminished by being forced to reveal his secret name to Isis, thereby giving her access to some of his magical power.

In a dream, the goddess told Bellerophon of a golden bridle that could be used to catch the Pegasus. When he awoke he had the bridle, with which he caught the Pegasus drinking at the Pirene well. He was able to control the beast thanks to the bridle and his equestrian skill. Together they flew to the Chimera's lair, where he used a spear to lodge a lump of lead in its throat.

They live in fresh or brackish water such as rivers and lakes throughout sub-Saharan Africa. They use a variety of hunting techniques, from corralling fish and stunning terrestrial prey with their tails, to ambushing large animals with their jaws and then dragging them into the water to drown. They will even wedge drowning animals under trees or rocks. Crocodiles have difficulty removing bites from their prey, so they perform a 'death roll' to use their body weight as leverage to tear off pieces of meat.\n\nLike most crocodilians, Nile crocodile females are attentive mothers. They construct large nests a short distance from the water where they lay their eggs, and then guard the nest for two or three months until the young hatch. After they hatch, the mother continues to attend to the young until they are about two years old. They are solitary for most of their lives; large groups of crocodiles gather together around food supplies, but are not herding or schooling in the technical sense.\n\nCrocodiles differ from alligators by being larger and venturing into salt water.

They specialize in hunting large herbivores, such as wildebeests and zebras, but have been known to eat virtually all African land animals over a few pounds. Like all cats, lions have great acceleration but poor stamina, so they rely on ambush and group tactics to catch their prey. Most lions attack from within 100 feet of a target prey animal. Even so, a great percentage of animals still manage to escape.\n\nWhile the conventional wisdom is that females do most of the hunting, male lions are quite capable individual hunters. Female lions are social, which allows them to hunt cooperatively, while males are solitary and spend much of their energy patrolling a large territory. Females need to spend extra time hunting since the male takes no part in caring for the young. Female lions form prides of two-to-eighteen related individuals, making them the only truly social cat. While hunting in groups may be effective, it is not dramatically more effective then hunting alone, since more food must be gathered to feed the entire pride. It is more likely that females socialize to help defend their cubs from male lions.\n\nHistorically, the range of the lion extended up into Europe. However, lions have been extinct in Europe for about 2,000 years and are presently confined to conservation areas in sub-Saharan Africa. A relict population of about 250 of the Asiatic lion sub-species still exists in India. While they do attack people, lion existence is also at odds with the widespread cattle culture of Africa."

While bulkier vessels could only be moored in a harbor, longboats could be beached right on the shore.
